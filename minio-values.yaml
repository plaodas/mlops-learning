# When using the official `minio/minio` image (not Bitnami), ensure the container
# starts the server subcommand. By default the chart expects Bitnami's image which
# wraps the startup; for the official image we provide command/args below.

  - "server"
  - "/bitnami/minio/data"

# Disable the Bitnami console until a compatible console image/tag is selected
